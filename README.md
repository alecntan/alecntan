**I'm Alec, and I build things with code** :hammer:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an [app for managing teams expenses](https://github.com/alecntan/BudgetBuddy)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning algorithms and the Spring Framework
- :wave: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecntan/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love the [Stormlight Archives](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series/)!

<!-- I also write about what I've learned and the things I've built on my [blog](https://blog.alectan.dev/) :grin: -->
